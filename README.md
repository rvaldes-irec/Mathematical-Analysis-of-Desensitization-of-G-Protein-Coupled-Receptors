# Mathematical-Analysis-of-Desensitization-of-G-Protein-Coupled-Receptors

You can test the tool provided in "parameter_fitting_least_squares_method.ipynb" to estimate the optimal value of the rate constant of dissociation k_ds that best fits a given distribution.

You can test the tool provided in "symbolic_computation.ipynb" in order to compute the analytical solution of the Receptor Desensitization depending on Receptor Activation model.
